--Always do a select before a delete to make sure you get back exactly what you want and only what you want to delete! Since we cannot delete anything from the pre-defined tables ( foreign key restraints ), use the following SQL code to create a dummy table:
CREATE TABLE practice_delete ( name TEXT, type TEXT, value INTEGER );
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'bronze', 50);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'silver', 100);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'silver', 100);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);
INSERT INTO practice_delete ( name, type, value ) VALUES ('delete', 'gold', 150);

SELECT * FROM practice_delete;

 --Copy, paste, and run the SQL code from the summary.

1. --Delete all 'bronze' entries from the table.
delete from practice_delete where type = 'bronze';

2. --Delete all 'silver' entries from the table.
delete from practice_delete where type = 'silver';

3. --Delete all entries whose value is equal to 150.
delete from practice_delete where value = 150;
